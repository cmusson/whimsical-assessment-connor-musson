# Whimsical Frontend Challenge

You can use this starter kit to kick things off. **This is completely
optional**; Please use whatever tools you are most comfortable with.

This starter kit uses the build tool [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Run the project

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and run the following commands:

```
npm ci
npm run watch
```

This will spin up a local web server at http://localhost:3000 using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Finding your way around the project

Upon viewing the page, `index.html` will execute the `init` function
within `main.js`. Use this hook script to initialize your code.

Place any styles or other public resources within the `public` folder.
